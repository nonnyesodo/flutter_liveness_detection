# 🧠 flutter_liveness_detection

**flutter_liveness_detection** is a powerful and easy-to-integrate Flutter plugin that enables **real-time liveness detection** using the device’s front camera.  
This plugin validates the presence of a live human being by detecting natural facial movements such as:

- 👁️ Eye Blinking
- 😄 Smiling
- 🔄 Head movement (left and right)

> Ideal for applications that require face-based identity verification, such as **KYC**, **biometric login**, or **attendance systems**.
